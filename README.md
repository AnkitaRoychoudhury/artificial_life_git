# artificial_life_git

In this branch (a6_2), I create a kinematic chain that has a random number (between 1 and 10) of links with random number of sensors (between 1 and # of links) in a chain. Sensors are randomly selected and the links with sensors are colored green. Links without sensors are blue. An example is shown below:

You can run this code by cloning branch a6_2 and running 'python search.py' in your terminal.
